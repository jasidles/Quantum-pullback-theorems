The MathOverflow question 'In quantum dynamical simulations, what is the 
symmetric (Riemannian) analog of a Poisson bracket?' refers to this theorem

Inspiration for this github repository came largely from Michael Nielsen's github repository:

   "The-Fermionic-canonical-commutation-relations-and-the-Jordan-Wigner-transform" 
    https://github.com/mnielsen/The-Fermionic-canonical-commutation-relations-and-the-Jordan-Wigner-transform

In particular, the quantum pullback theorem given here applies also to fermionic 
(anti-commutating) quantum operators, with $\omega\to g$, where $\omega$ is the 
canonical Kahlerian symplectic form of Hilbert space, and $g$ is the canonical 
Riemannian metric of Hilbert space.

What does this mean, geometrically, algebraically, and physically?  

It is intended that this question will be asked on the MathOverflow forum; 
this Quantum-pullback-theorems repository was prepared for that purpose.
